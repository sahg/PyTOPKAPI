PyTOPKAPI is a BSD licensed Python library implementing the TOPKAPI
Hydrological model (Liu and Todini, 2002). The model is a
physically-based and fully distributed hydrological model, which has
already been successfully applied in several countries around the
world (Liu and Todini, 2002; Bartholomes and Todini, 2005; Liu et al.,
2005; Martina et al., 2006; Vischel et al., 2008).

Download
--------

Source releases of the PyTOPKAPI code can be downloaded from
http://github.com/sahg/PyTOPKAPI/downloads

Install
-------

The PyTOPKAPI package currently consists of pure Python code and does
not require any extension modules to be built. However the model
depends on a number of 3rd party Python packages, these are: NumPy
(http://www.numpy.org), SciPy (http://www.scipy.org) and PyTables
(http://www.pytables.org).

Once the pre-requisite Python packages have been successfully
installed, PyTOPKAPI can be installed at the command line for any
operating system:

    $ python setup.py install

The installation can be tested in the Python interpreter:

    >>> import pytopkapi
